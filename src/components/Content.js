        This doc in your private channel, where you can store your private work.
        You can share docs one by one from here, but to properly organise your
        team knowledge base, use workspace channels. <br /> <br />
        You can make channels <b>public</b> to make all docs visible to everyone
        on the team, or <b>private</b> if you want the channel's docs to only be
        visible by a selection of teammates.
